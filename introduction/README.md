  <h1>Analysis of algorithm:</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>CP</strong> Combines two topics. 
    <br>
    1. The design of Algorithms<br>
    2. The implementation of Algorithms.

    Design -> Problem solving & mathematical thinking

    Implementation -> Write codes to implement the logics.

    Complexity analysis is defined as a technique to characterise the time taken by an 
    algorithm with respect to input size (independent from the machine, language and compiler). 
    It is used for evaluating the variations of execution time on different algorithms.
<br>
    
    What is the need for Complexity Analysis?
    1. Complexity Analysis determines the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
    2. It is used for comparing different algorithms on different input sizes.
    3. Complexity helps to determine the difficulty of a problem.
    often measured by how much time and space (memory) it takes to solve a particular problem
  
<strong>Orders of growth:</strong>
<p>
  The order of growth of an algorithm is an approximation of the <strong>time required to run a computer program as the input size increases.</strong> The order of growth ignores the constant factor needed for fixed operations and focuses instead on the operations that increase proportional to input size. For example, a program with a linear order of growth generally requires double the time if the input doubles.
  <br>

The order of growth is often described using either Big-Theta or Big-O notation, but that notation is out of scope for this course.
